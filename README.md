# DailyTechJournalVault

Welcome to **DailyTechJournalVault** — a chronological journal of my technical growth.  
Every day, I log concepts I explore, projects I touch, bugs I battle, and systems I break & rebuild.

> _“Not confused. Just building.”_

## 🗓️ Format & Philosophy

This repo is organized **by day**, not by topic.  
Because real learning doesn’t happen in silos — it’s messy, interconnected, and alive.

Each entry might include:
- Concepts explored (Spring Boot, MQL, SQL, etc.)
- Notes from projects or videos
- Diagrams, analogies, or code snippets
- Bugs faced & lessons learned
- APIs, commands, or tools used
- Reflections, insights, and TODOs

## Topics I’m Actively Learning

- **3DEXPERIENCE / ENOVIA / MQL / JPO**
- **Spring Boot / REST APIs / Security**
- **MySQL / SQL Joins / Queries**
- **DSA in Java**
- **DevOps Tools (Docker, GitHub Actions, AWS)**
- **Soft Skills / Journaling / Mindset**
